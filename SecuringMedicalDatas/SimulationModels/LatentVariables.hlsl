  //RK4 called in different several functions or classes before can help us having a momentum. Then, we better use genetic algorithms
  //(I have to don something better in the futur) that is also a neural network. We will use h=h*exp(h) later because we have a finite corpus.




  //First, we have to use some finite corpus theorems becauuse patching is usually not good for models nowadays.
  //To merge results, then, we will have to inject code not in all programs but programs that we can patch

  //we have to test files on the OS that use smart pointers only and done with some libraries ! Not all libraries !
