# Crypto-currency-project-1---Champo__also new os based on securing medical datas
We can try ! I will try to do it from scratch again !
forgive me im a little bit crazy but it seems that this repository hold crypto currency linked with nuclear crisis for economy.
can be used in computer graphucs to state GRF behaviour 

let me tell you that according to my ecent formulas and classes that securing medical datas seems to be linked with libraries that you use in any os.
 I will use physics to implement some parts of this OS or use fully physics to do that because of my recent resedarches in physics : exp(11^2)=cos(x)+i*sin(x).
 This is possible in physics to start with this formula first because of log(x). Now I have to create a folder OS/Logarithm/Scheduller/CeramicsAlternativesTwiceReuse.h
  because civil buildings were described by me in a former repository. I mean log(x) = 0 <=> -Inf. Then, exp(11^2) wiill never reach -Inf by intuition and then,
  ceramicsAlternatives can be reused as a scheduller or maybe somewhere else later.

  last update.
  i want use some files at cgi repository to add functions on this repository. more precisely, this is the multilayerdetectionby.hlsl
  it seems that we can use it on telecom projects too. i will do another telecom project. cheers.


i think i can use this surgery of heart tool made by myself from scratch to get the maximum number of money that can be hold worldwide. i repeat, im not a doctor.! then, this id time to plzy a game with those things. sure.

accordi'g to my last recipe in maths and physics, we ddont really need a model or models. then, we can state energy equations like scrum coins but i need to go further in my older researches in maths and study another field.
