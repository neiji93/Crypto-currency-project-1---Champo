//From scratch, the generalized series can be defined as the most most developped thing I made !

//quaternions, prime numbers and integrals ? Yes, we can take the rendering eququation of kajiya 
//and the BRDF or the GRF (not the BSDF) !. So here, in order to send protocol datas filled with static
//strings (or char*), we have to set many textures sampling techniques with automorph keyowrd !
//...
//On the other hand, it was good to use mathematical automorph techniques to create C physical functions !!!!! YES !!!

  //Important notice : even with direct lighting, I did some stuffs that I lost which
  //use a huge .hlsl file for direct lighting with BRDF. But with GRF, I'm not sure about direct
  //lighting. That said, this is perfectly ok if we use blockChain for GRF !!!! This is a stuff
