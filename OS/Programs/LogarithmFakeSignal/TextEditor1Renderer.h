//It was a good idea to keep in mind randoomly done equations or functions
//in the full program. Now, in order to dispatch them to GPU with Planck's constant
//and other muted constants, we need to send many signals. In order to get a non crashing
//rendering, we have to use contracts of functions that were not internally done for pphysics and then...
//I must stop it now although this is a way !
//If we use physics, we have then to use exp(h^11) * hyperbolic function1 (from scratch as I'm an artist !).
//As we did before, h^11 must be too high, then we will have to use h^2 and wwe have to synchronize signals too !
//Plus, I have to check if all those program contains physical formulas as I said in this repository
//at starting block !
//This is cool that I'm a recognized artist ! In the math reseatch repository, I also claimed that I have an infinite
//science from scratch ! haha ! lol !
