//containers may help the user interface that can be

//for major user interactivity. This is the fact that 
//we can have a random equation or function here because we 
//enquired the way to use queues. Then, no need to check arbitrary
//formulas.
//By the way, here, we can have objects in memory. This function can be an
//alternative way to smart pointers ! Let's check secure methods later !
