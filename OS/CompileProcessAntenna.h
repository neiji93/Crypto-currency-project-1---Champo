//yhe first idea is that this os play too many games
//then datas are forced to come into hd. the second idea that claim
//that it is suited for crypto curre'cy is that the algorithmd entrred by users
//can be various and hidden in the compile immediate process. there must br a way.

//accordi'g to my previous researches in math
//which state the end of mathd, it is possible now to 
//deal with "knowledge" and then create a maximum
//nested pointer.
